#This is the file for custom mob drops.
#Currently, the format is as follows:
#
#mob name -> id : data x min - max, id : data x min - max
#
#For example, to make creepers drop 10 to 20 tnt:
#
#creeper->46x10-20
#You can also append to mob drops by adding a + to the end of the mobs name.

#And to add names to drops..
#creeper->1|Named Stonex2-5%1
#And to add enchantments to drops..
#creeper->1;DAMAGE_ALL:3|Named Stonex2-5%1
