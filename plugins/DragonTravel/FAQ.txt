Welcome to the the DragonTravel FAQ textfile.
In this file, some questions about DragonTravel are answered.
Also some random stuff is just written on some places, because
being a server administrator needs more fun and stuff, right?

> Who made DragonTravel?
- Penguins. Well XemsDoom(Developer) and Phiwa(Documenter).

> Can you be serious?
- Sure and also tired but here you go:

> The dragon sometimes looks into the wrong direction, what can I do?
- This is caused by the client itself, but on clients with more
  frames per second, this usually does not occur or less.

> I want to run DragonTravel on a server without a PermissionManager
- Alright, open the DragonTravel.jar file, you will find a "plugin.yml"
  in there. Open it with NotePad++ and not a shitty editor please.
  Change every "default: op" you see to "default: true", this means
  that all players get the permission, instead of only the operators.
  After you are done editing the file, put it back into the DragonTravel.jar

> Economy does not work, I don't have any withdraw.
- As a server administrator, you likely got the permission
  dt.nocost, which disables withdraws for you.
  
> DragonTravel does not work
- If you set "Economy" to "true" in the config but did not install
  the plugin "Vault", then DragonTravel will disable itself
- If you try to run DragonTravel with an outdated config or
  messages file, then DragonTravel will disable itself
- If you like cakes, then DragonTravel is a lie and disables itself
  
> The dragon flys really glitchy or laggy.
  First of all, DragonTravel itself is NOT glitchy, this shuttered
  movement is coming from your server or client. The performance
  on one side or both is bad, that causes the dragon to not move fluid.

On Server:
- Try to decrease the view-distance, this will give your server a good
  performance boost, as less chunks are generally loaded.
- Fix errors which appear in the log, plugins having errors can decrease
  the server performance a lot.
- Decrease the dragon's speed in the configuration file.
On Client:
- Decrease the view-distance
- Maybe get OptiFine?, usually OptiFine increases performance

> The dragon flys through blocks.
- We can't change that in an efficient way

> Is it possible to remove the boss-health bar?
- No it is not, the boss-health bar is client-sided,
  you can try to hire a dev, which will modify the vanilla Minecraft client,
  but why throw out money.

> Where are the permission-nodes?
  Some lines under me {-_-}
